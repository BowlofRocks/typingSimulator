## Overview

**Project Title**: Lil'Gloomy

**Project Description**: 
A competitive typing game that challenges players to type as fast and as accurate as they can.
**Project Goals**: 
- Have a database that stores the data of each user
- Have a leaderboard that uses that database to display wpm and accuracy info
- Have a prompt box that will display different prompts for users to type up
- Have a keyboard with a heat map that will display user error while typing
- Have words per minute and accuracy percentage appear after finishing prompt
- Have a store that will accumulate money after each prompt, storing different skins that the user can purchase
- Have animations for the program that will make it more appealing to users
- Add styling to the webpage
- Create a "company" logo
